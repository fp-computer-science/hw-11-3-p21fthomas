### Nested Loops

---
Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw11-3-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file.

1. (5 pts.) Write a program that is similar to Lab 4-1 from this cycle, but instead of making the student's name possessive, add each student's last initial to their name. Be sure to use the following lists in your solution:
   ```
   last_initials = ["A", "B", "B", "D", "D", "G", "G", "J", "K", "L", "P", "S", "T", "T", "V", "W"]

   rows = [["Darick", "Eugene", "Kyle", "Azaan"], ["Ryan", "Phil", "Eman", "Alex", "Nicholas"], ["Christian", "Josh", "Matt", "Francesco"], ["Patrick", "Nico", "Trevayne"]]

   ```
   Your program must not create any new lists and must modify `rows` so that the result of `print(rows)` is this:
   ```
   [['Darick A.', 'Eugene B.', 'Kyle B.', 'Azaan D.'], ['Ryan D.', 'Phil G.', 'Eman G.', 'Alex J.', 'Nicholas K'], ['Christian L.', 'Josh P.', 'Matt S.', 'Francesco T.'], ['Patrick T.', 'Nico V.', 'Trevayne W.']]
   ```
2. (10 pts.) Click on the following link and fill in the tracing chart for the iterations that correspond with your name. Be sure to put a number after "Inner Iteration" for the number iteration of the inner `for` loop that processes your name, and a number after "Outer Iteration" for the number iteration of the outer `for` loop that processes your row. The first and last lines of the chart have been completed for you.

    All your solutions will be added together to create a tracing chart for the entire program. If all the lines together correctly trace the program, the entire class will receive ___5 bonus points___ on this assignment.
